# FFXIV Endcounter

ACT cannot directly see when combat has ended/started in FFXIV. To alleviate this, users can manually end an encounter with a macro which simply echos the word 'end' into chat

This plugin simply automates this process and will send 'end' into chat whenever combat has ended.

There is also an option to enable a reminder to clear all encounter data when you enter a duty.
